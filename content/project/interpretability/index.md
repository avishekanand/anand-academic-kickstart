Predictive models are all pervasive with usage in search engines, recommender systems, health, legal and financial domains. But for the most part they are used as black boxes which output a prediction, score or rankings without understanding partially or even completely how different features influence the model prediction.
In such cases when an algorithm prioritizes information to predict, classify or rank; algorithmic transparency becomes an important feature to keep tabs on restricting discrimination and enhancing explainability-based trust in the system.

Consequently, we end up with accurate yet non-interpretable models. We have been working on building models that are either interpretable by design or approaches that explain in a post-hoc manner the rationale behind a prediction by an already trained model. Specifically, we have proposed different interpretability approaches to audit ranking models in the context of Web search.

Recently, we investigated the difference between human understanding and machine understanding of images in using post-hoc interpretability approaches. In particular, we seek to answer the following questions: Which (well performing) complex ML models are closer to humans in their use of features to make accurate predictions? How does task difficulty affect the feature selection capability of machines in comparison to humans? Are humans consistently better at selecting features that make image recognition more accurate?
