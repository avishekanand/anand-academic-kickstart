![SIGIR 2020](/img/SIGIR2020_logo.png)

This July, [Rishiraj Saha Roy](http://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~rsaharo/) and me are giving a tutorial on Question Answering (QA) in SIGIR 2020. We will mostly cover recent research in QA in the last five years mostly focussing on approaches involving knowledge graphs and text. You can find the paper relating to the tutorial on arxiv right [here.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.11980.pdf)


The link to the Webpage with the resources, slides and videos will follow soon.
